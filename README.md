# Fisher LDA
Implementation of the Fisher LDA function for multi-class problem.

LDA and Fisher Linear Discriminant (Fisher-LDA) are very similar techniques for finding a direction along which separation of 2-class data is good. In contrast to PCA, which identified the direction of maximum variance of the data, irrespective of which class it belonged to, LDA explicitly looks for a projection that maximises the separation of two classes. Standard LDA and Fisher-LDA differ in the way they model each class. Indeed LDA supposes the two classes to be of equal variance, while Fisher-LDA computes the variance separately for each class.
